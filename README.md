This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) "Full Stack JavaScript" course. Built in ReactJS, this project focuses on practising React's `useEffect` hook for handling side effects and API calls. All Pokémon IDs, names, and images are fetched from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
